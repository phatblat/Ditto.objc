 The identity types you can use with DittoObjC.

 The various identity configurations that you can use when initializing a
 `DITDitto` instance.

 - Development: (Deprecated - use OfflinePlayground instead) Develop
   peer-to-peer apps with no cloud connection. This mode offers no security and
   must only be used for development.
 - OfflinePlayground: Develop peer-to-peer apps with no cloud connection. This
   mode offers no security and must only be used for development.
 - Online: (Deprecated - use OnlineWithAuthentication instead) Run Ditto in
   secure production mode, logging on to Ditto Cloud or on on-premises
   authentication server. User permissions are centrally managed.
 - OnlineWithAuthentication: Run Ditto in secure production mode, logging on to
   Ditto Cloud or on on-premises authentication server. User permissions are
   centrally managed.
 - OnlinePlayground: Test a Ditto Cloud app without authentication ("Playground
   mode"). This mode offers no security and must only be used for development.
 - SharedKey: A mode where any device is trusted provided they know the secret
   key. This is a simplistic authentication model normally only suitable for
   private apps where users and devices are both trusted.
 - Manual: A manually-provided certificate identity. This accepts a
   base64-encoded bundle.
